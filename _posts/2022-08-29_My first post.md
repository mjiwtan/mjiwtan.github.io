 ## Data Scientist and Statistician
 
 What do you think being a data scientist is about?
 
 According to me, a data scientist is someone who is a blend of statistician,programmer and a specific domain expert. Data scientist possess theoritical knowledge and technical skills to work on huge data and extract some useful information which could help in solving an existing problem.
 
 What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?
 
 Basic responsibility of a data scientist is to gather and analyse data so that business decisions can be made on the insights obtained from the data. A data scientist works on data pre-processing so that the data is in a proper and concise manner and doesn't contain irregularities so that it con be used for further analyses and modeling. They are focused on implementing different machine learning model and choose one which fits the data best. Along with that, a data scientist should be able to communicate his modeling methods and analyses of the data to the business team.
 
 A data scientist can come from various different fields like health, finance, mathematics, computer science,etc as they must be able to understand the data and the inference in their field of expertise.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

Similarity: Knowledge of statistics to get useful information from the data.

Differences: 
1.Data scientist work on huge data set, while statistican work on small data set.

2. Data scientist work on different methods to get the best ML model, while statisticians try to improve on simple model according to data.

3. Data scientist are more application based while statistician use more theoritical approach.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I see myself more of a data scientist  as I have previously worked with huge dataset and transformed them into a cleaner version. I have always been inclined to use the machine learning model to genarate useful insights into finance domain.
