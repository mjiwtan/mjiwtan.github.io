Hello Everyone

Last week I got an exciting opportunity to work on a data science project. The scope of the project was to get the data from various sources, perform data processing using functions and explain the results using vizualization using various libraries .

The project was a great learning experience as it tested my data manipulation and vizualization skills. I would like to shed some lights on learnings I had from the project.
1. The project revolved around on how to handle the data, perform certain data manipulation task based on the conditions given
2. Got a good exposure of using function designed to perform a particular task. Using function is really important when we have to perform a lot of task multiple times. In the project we were able to create functions and traverse from one function to another.
3. The project emphasized on how ggplot is important for vizualization. I was able to plot the graph along with using class functionality through which someone can explain a trend or generate a understanding about a dataset which can be further use for making critical business decisions

I think the project helpwd to learn some R functionalities however there were things that could have done differently:
1. A lot of functionalities were used and I think some more research in those functionalities could have done as it would ave made a project little less challenging.
2. For our own understanding we could have experimented in the ggplot by going through the documentation and try to understand different type of knowledge that can be extracted from the dataset.

I would love to share my work on this project and will really appreciate any feedback on it. Here is the link to the project.
