Hello Everyone,

Last week had been really exciting for me as I got to work on yet another data science project providing me with exposure to git and github functionalities along with interacting with different API endpoints and extracting the data to perform Exploratory Data Analysis for decision making purposes.
I would like to share my experience about the things I handle, new learnings and the challenges that I faced during the project.

**Learnings from the project**

Prior to beginning the job, I studied the problem description to gain a better understanding of what needed to be done. 
Second, we evaluated the datasets and decided to go forward with Financial Data as it has a lot of various endpoints.

Tasks
1. To start, we set up the repository, which entailed configuring the repository itself, and to make the necessary setting adjustments, created github pages and linked the our repo with R studio to use the git functionality

2. Interacted with various endpoints of Financial API to help a user extract the data according to their wish. Users have the flexibility to specify the input and get the desired results.

3. Created new variables based on the API function call and worked on exploratory data analysis and produced contingency table, various plots and graphs, numerical summaries.

This project overall gave an idea how it looks to work in a team aiming for a common goal. I learned how to manage and work on a project with a team or group, which helped me better grasp how to operate in a team. Along with that, I learnt code interaction and management which is one on the crucial aspect while working on a project.

**Challenging Part**

1. Initially we got on stuck on which API we should use to get the dataset as it is important to understand the dataset first to use it for analysis.

2. After selecting the API, we found it difficult to choose the endpoints and the modification required on that data set. For that we studied each and every endpoint and the data it contains.
 At the end we went with Daily Prices, Tickers and Dividend API.
 
3. Third challenge that we faced was to make the functions user friendly. We need to map tickers and symbols to the user provided strings. Along with that we need to make sure that the user entered dates matches with the dates in the dataset.

4. We faced a few problem while plotting as we need to figure out what categorical and numerical variable should be used for plotting the graph.

For future work, I will try to work on understanding the data better and how various variable are related to each other. The other thing I want to focus on is plotting the different graph for various variable and exploring different ggplot functionalities.
