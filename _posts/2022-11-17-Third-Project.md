In the last week I got to work on data science project where we have to use Machine Algorithms to predict number of shares for a particular news article. I used Online News Popularity Data set to make predictions for articles published by Mashable.

## What would you do differently?
For the project I performed feature selection to use relevent features. However I could have used univariate and bivariate anlysis and eliminated few of the variables beforehand. Also I could have given a try to best subset selection to check whether it yields better resut or not. Also, i could have experiment with parameter selection for ensemble methods and observe the results and whether such process are computationally expensive.

## What was the most difficult part for you?
I faced a difficulty in creating categorical variables for working on EDA. To resolve it, I worked on understanding the data in a better way. The second difficuly I faced was to automate the whole model development and publish the html sites for each data channel.

## What are your big take-aways from this project?
 I think this project as a world gives a glimpse how model development looks like in a real world as we got involved in Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, feature selection and model building. Overall this project gave me a good experience of a model development cycle. Along with that I got a chance to do automation which I have not done previously helped to gain a new skill.
