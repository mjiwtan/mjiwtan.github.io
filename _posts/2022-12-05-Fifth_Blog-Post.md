Hello Everyone,

We are the end of our course ST588 and it has been an exciting journey. 

I would like to disciss a few things that this course has helped to achieve and how can I used the skills gained in this course.

What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

I think the most important thing I learned from the class how can we handle the data. Even before modeling it is imperative that we are able to handle our data well. The data manipulation technique learned in this course,  I will try to implement this in practice.
We have done a lot of EDA in the course and I would like to follow the similar approach when I am working full-time. Fitting the model is not only sufficient to build a model, we need to make sure that we use the correct hyperparameters and test the validity of the model. I want to make sure that in future I follow all of the necessary steps while working full time.

Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about? 
I think I will always be connected to data science in one way or the others. I have got a full time job at Freddie Mac as Quantitative Model Validator. My job revolves around studying the model and trying to improve by using my data science skills. Working in full time will help me polish my skills more as I will get to learn a lot during this process.
I have a good experience with linear models however, I want to work with non-linear models as it is more complex and can be used in many different industries.
