Hi Everyone,

My name is Madhur Jiwtani and I come from Amravati, a small but amazing city in Maharashtra, India. I have done my bachelors in Information Technology from Mumbai. When I was in my last year of engineering I got a chance to work as a Trader which really change my career trajectory. I think, working as a trader was one of the best experience I had as it not only help me analytically but psychologically as well. I aspire to work into risk modeling as I have a penchant towards quantitative and computational side of finance. So, I am currently pursuing Masters in Financial Mathematics from North Carolina State University. Apart from education, I love playing cricket and I am a part of the NCSU cricket Team "Wolfpack".  
I am writing this blog to share my idea about data science and the new relevent things in data science I am going to learn in future.
